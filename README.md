# Overview
For this project I decided to try to learn Java Script. TO do this I decided on trying to create a Memory Matching Card Game. With learning javascript I learned how to create a basic output to a browser, and DOM use.

For this software One opens the html file in the browser  to run it. Then one can start playing the game by selecting various "cards" which then reveal what they are. One can then Slowly flip over two cards at a time and match cards. Once a match is found it is hidden from view and one can continue on with matching others. This software uses general emojis from the windows emjoi clipboard.

The purpose in creating this software was to learn the basics of javascript and some of the basics of website creation.

# Development Environment
To write the code I used Visual Studio Code. Then to run the software once coded I used the webbrowser Microsoft Edge.

For this project I used HTML, Javascript, and CSS languages each in seprate files all working together to create the program.

# Future Work
- Make it so you can't reveal more than 2 cards at a time
- Instead of Emojis use custom images
- Create a better webpage
